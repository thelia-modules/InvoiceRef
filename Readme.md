# Invoice Number module

This module allows you to manage the invoice number for your orders.

## Installation

* Copy the module into ```<thelia_root>/local/modules/``` directory and be sure that the name of the module is InvoiceRef.
* Activate it in your thelia administration panel

## Usage

Once installed, you have to set the invoice number used by Thelia. After that, this number will be increased after each payment. For example if you start with number 1000, this number will be increased by 1 after each payment so you will have 1000, after 1001, after 1002, etc.

If you don't set this number, it will start with number 1
